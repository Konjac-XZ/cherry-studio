# Agent Notes

## Working Environment
- You are currently in WSL2 without a suitable runtime; skip all test commands because the user will run them manually and report back.
- Work happens on a personal branch aimed at the user's own needs, so you can ignore compatibility concerns that would normally matter for general releases.

Refer to `CLAUDE.md` for the broader repository guidelines.
